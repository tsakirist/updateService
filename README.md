# updateService

**Client-server model architecture.**  
Client is an update service which runs an application and checks the server in short time intervals,  
about newer versions of the application.  
It then extracts, installs dependencies, and executes the application from within the service.(e.g **fork**)

# Install
Install dependencies.
```
  npm install
```
# Options
You can change the configuration from the **.json** files, inside **config** folders.
